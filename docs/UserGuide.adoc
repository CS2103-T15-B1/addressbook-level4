== Introduction

Retail Analytics (RA) is for *retailers who handle hundreds to thousands of customers and orders and who are comfortable with using a desktop app to manage their analytics*. More importantly, RA is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RA can get your customer analytics tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Retail Analytics.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a person: `addperson`

Adds a person to Retail Analytics app. +
Format: `addperson n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS g/GENDER lat/LATITUDE lon/LONGITUDE [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `addperson n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street g/M lat/1.2345 lon/31.1, block 123, #01-01`
* `addperson n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 g/F lat/1.321 lon/32.5 t/criminal`

=== Adding a product: `addproduct`

Adds a product to Retail Analytics app. +
Format: `addproduct n/NAME pr/PRICE c/CATEGORY`

[NOTE]
The number listed beside the product entry in the GUI is not the displayed index, but the unique id permanently associated with a given product.

Example:

* `addproduct n/Egg pr/$1 c/Food`

=== Adding an order: `addorder`
Adds an order to Retail Analytics app. +
Format: `addorder e/EMAIL o/SUBORDER [o/MORE_SUBORDERS]...` where `SUBORDER` consists of `PRODUCT_ID QUANTITY COST`.

[NOTE]
The number listed beside the order entry in the GUI is not the displayed index, but the unique id permanently associated with given order.

[TIP]
An order must have at least one suborder. Prices are recorded separately to prevent retroactive sales figure changes when product prices are modified after an order has been made.

Examples:

* `addorder e/alex@example.com o/1 2 $3` adds an order where alex bought 2 pieces of product whose id is 1 for $3 each.
* `addorder e/bernice@example.com o/1 1 $1 o/2 1 $1` adds an order where alex bought 1 of product 1 for $1 and 1 of product 2 for $1, making $2 total.

=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. Updates the order view to only show the order made by the persons found.+
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

// tag::findproducts[]
=== Locating products by name: `findproductbyname`

Finds products whose names contain any of the given keywords.
Format: `findproductbyname KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

[NOTE]
Like `find`, the search is case insensitive and the keyword order does not matter. Only the name is searched and perfect keyword matches will be returned.

=== Finding all products within a certain price range: `findproductbyprice`
Filters out all the products within the range [`MIN_PRICE`, `MAX_PRICE`] and displays them in the GUI.

*Format*: `findproductbyprice minpr/MIN_PRICE maxpr/MAX_PRICE`

*Example*:

* `findproductbyprice minpr/10 maxpr/200` finds products with price between 10 and 200, inclusive

=== Find all products of a certain category: `findproductbycategory`
Filters out all the products of a specific category and displays them in the GUI.

*Format*: `findproductbycategory CATEGORY [MORE_CATEGORIES]...`

*Examples*:

* `findproductbycategory Clothing` +
Finds all products of category `Clothing`
* `findproductbycategory Clothing health` +
Finds all products of category `Clothing` and `Health`
// end::findproducts[]

// tag::recommend[]
=== Finding product recommendations for a person: `recommend`
Given a person, analyzes the app's entire order history to train a predictive model that guesses which products are likely to appeal to a given person. 

Outputs a list of (`product name`, `predicted chance of purchase`), ranked in descending order of predicted chance of purchase.

image::RecommendEg.jpg[width="600"]

[IMPORTANT]
The model makes predictions only considering the persons' _age_ and _gender_. To cap the influence of high volume buyers, multiple purchases of the same product are ignored. +

An analogous use would be how companies like Amazon know which products to recommend you in their targeted emails. Now, you can do the same for your business too. +

*For v2.0*: Support for consideration of predictive factors other than age and gender, and the option to not recommend products a user has already bought.

*Format*: `recommend INDEX`

[TIP]
The sample data provided includes an order history of mostly younger persons buying `TrendyShirt`, older persons buying `Dentures`, females buying `Lipstick`, and a general audience for `Toothbrush`. You can casually validate the algorithm by noticing that the recommendations for a younger person ranks `TrendyShirt` at the front of the output, while `Dentures` will be right at the rear. Experiment by adding different persons, products, and orders, and see how he recommendations respond!

*Example*:

* `recommend 1` finds recommendations for person whose last shown index is 1.
// end::recommend[]

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in Retail Analytics. +
Format: `list`

=== Displays the geographic distribution of queried customers in Retail Analytics with clustering: `map`

Displays spread of queried people in Retail Analytics on a map with clustering.
Zooming in and out of the map causes the clustering to change.

Possible Formats:

* Query 1) `all`: Select all customers
** Format: `map all`
** Example: `map all`
* Query 2) `name`: Select customer if keyword in name
** Format: `map name NAME [NAME]...`

[TIP]
The map clusters people by location. These clusters are displayed as blue dots.

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in Retail Analytics. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[NOTE]

* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
